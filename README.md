# mealPicker - a personal menu curator

This project came about during the pandemic as an automation for meal planing. I was fed up
with having to come up with meal ideas on the spot when I went shopping. I tried to have
a rule to cook food I haven't eaten for a while, but I don't have perfect memory. This often 
lead to quite simple and bland food.
Once I got about to implement the frequency tracking of the meals, the tool actually started
being more convenient than cumbersome. It is very handy to not have to worry about what
things I need to cook or shop for.
I currently only use this for my main meals of the day, but it can easily be expanded to
all meals in the day.

The script had different verions and the current one does pretty much all I ever wanted from
it. It implements my "rule" to pick foods I haven't had in a while, accounts for the comlexity
and the environmental impact of the meals, and integrates with a web service that I can 
easily use on my phone (I integrated google Tasks API as well as Notion API).

Alongside the sript I also built a personal collection of recipies and ingredients, which is 
also quite convenient on its own. This collection is also included in the project.
